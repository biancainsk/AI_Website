# This Project aims to implement three methods for parameter estimation:
    1. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
    2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation
    3. Bayesian Inference

ESTIMATION PROBLEM: Understanding the height of Python programmers.  
A. We assume that the model which best describes the data generation process is GAUSSIAN (Normal) => We estimate the mean and std

OBS:
* The Normal distribution when modelling natural phenomena like human heights.
* The Beta distribution when modelling probability distributions.
* The Poisson distribution when modelling the frequency of events occurring.

Each of these distributions have parameters: α and β for the beta distribution, λ for the Poisson,
lower and upper bounds for the uniform distribution, or μ and σ for the normal distribution of our example.
